ATMCode: My first project from my first computing class. Purpose of this project was to create a program that operates like an ATM, the program prompts the
user to verify their account number and pin, then once verified they may perform operations on the account. This was done in tandem with other partners so
it is quite flawed. One of my partners used a switch statement for exact, set account numbers rather than creating a method that allows for different account numbers 
to be entered into the file. This was my first time applying methods.

MidtermProject: My second project done in my second programming class. Purpose of this project was to create a program that operates as an employee directory where you
can load an initial set of employees and then add, remove, or sort employees based on ID number, salary, or name. You can retrieve individual employees or display 
all employees in the directory, as well as display specific employees depending on salary range. This project was my first time learning how to create classes with 
certain characteristics of our choosing.
